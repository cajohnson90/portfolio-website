        Hello there, üëã I'm a passionate full-stack developer on an exciting
        journey to explore and master new software technologies. After
        graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I pursued engineering
        roles in my college hometown, which eventually led me to start a new
        adventure in Seattle, where I am currently located in search of my next
        opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical background involves back-end and front-end web development,
        as well as writing CI/CD pipelines and performing automated testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not coding, I enjoy trying new types of food and new places,
        research new technologies, staying active through exercise, and hit the
        golf course ‚õ≥Ô∏è when I want a good challenge.
      </p>
